# Sample Eigen project

This project serves as an opinionated template project which includes:
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) \([repo](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen)\)
- [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark)

## Build Dependencies

- [CMake 3.14+](https://cmake.org/)
- [Conan](https://conan.io/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (to run Docker tests)

## Running tests

The following scripts have been tested on MacOS Monterey.

### Natively

Run `script/run_tests.sh`

### with Docker

Run `script/run_docker_tests.sh`

# VS Code integration

Open the project as a workspace using `project.code-workspace`.

Installing the extensions identified in `.vscode/extensions.json` will include, among other helpful
tools, the `ms-vscode.cmake-tools` extension. CMake Tools integrates CMake into VS Code to provide
code intellisense and other helpful build utilities.

All included VS Code support files expect the project to be built in a directory called `build`,
where a well-formed `compile_commands.json` file should also exist. Before features like
intellisense can work, CMake must first have completely configured and have successfully
placed its files in `build`. This is most easily achieved by simply running `script/run_tests.sh` at
least once, as it will acquire dependencies through Conan and then build the project in order to
test.

`compile_commands.json` is typically automatically
[generated by CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html).

There are currently intellisense bugs on MacOS due to CMake Tools. One such issue is being tracked
[here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/1178).
